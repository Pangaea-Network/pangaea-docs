## What is Pangaea? 

Pangaea is the worlds real estate blockchain. Pangaea allows property deeds to be securely stored and traded on-chain. The process of trading property is often a long and arduous process full of potential pitfalls, no longer!

## Goal of Pangaea

Pangaea's goal is to build a robust governance system around a NFT marketplace. Currently NFTs (Non-Fungible-Tokens) are used by the creative community to sell collectibles. The technology can also be used to tokenize real assets (land, car titles, etc.). One issue that comes up is that what if a malicious actor gets his/her hands on the private key associated with the NFT? Surely we cannot allow a hacker to become the owner of say your house or car. This is the issue Pangaea seeks to solve! Pangaea allows every asset to come with its own customization set of protocols to ensure a fair and sensible dispute resolutions.
